# Weaver-Solver
This repo contains an optimal solver for the word game "Weaver" written in C++. It goes beyond that though, as this program can find the optimal path between any 2 words with any number of letters.

I have posted my approaches and my final solution to my blog for anyone interested in reading about the development of this program. My blog can be found here: https://zor-blog.netlify.app
